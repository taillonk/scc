            <p>Seattle-based pop artist Nicky Buell is quickly establishing himself as a leading voice in the queer pop
              scene.
              He wants the LGBTQ+ community to feel seen and heard. Nicky has collaborated with iconic artists and
              producers
              throughout the Pacific Northwest including Phil Peterson (Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Lana Del Rey), Matthew
              Wolk
              (Dempsey Hope, Sam Lachow), and Seattle-based popstar Anna Thompson, his childhood best friend with whom he
              released ‘Thirsty.’ It was through this song that Nicky would publicly come out at the age of twenty. He
              followed ‘Thirsty’ with the releases of singles ‘Bromance’ and ‘Moonboy’ off his debut EP ‘Spongy Emerald
              Prince,’ a project that honors and chronicles his triumphs and heartbreak during his first year as an openly
              gay
              man. Having launched his project just four months ago, he’s already received press from major publications
              on
              the West Coast like Rage Robot, The Spokesman-Review, Unheard Gems, Mundane Mag and many more. Sonically,
              Nicky
              draws inspiration from artists like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande and John Legend. He not only sits in the
              pop
              realm but also bends the genre, adding in the occasional punchy rap verse to elevate his sound. Nicky is an
              artist you can root for, coming into his own through the creation of fun electronic-tinged pop anthems
              guaranteed to be stuck in your head for days.</p>
